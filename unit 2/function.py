# function - a function is a set of codde instructions
# a custom name that the computer will run.

# Function syntax (Rules of how its written)
# Function have 2 phases: function definition and
# function call

# for a computer to follow

# a function comes in 2 phases

# phasesz 1: function defintion
# we are describing the instruction for our custom mode.
# we are adding logic to the computers vocabulary.
# this code does not run- it only give the computer the meaning
# not the action



# this code to do. it only runs when we call it
def example():
      print('good moring') # 1 instruction print good moring

def example2(I):
      print('good day')

# phase 2: function call/invocation
# once we have the definion, we can now run the instructions
# by writing the function name.

# when we are ready to use a function,
# we write ito use it.
example()

# we indent of inform the computer that are about to write
# code instructions. if we dont, we will get an error


def example2():
     print('good moring')
     a= input('enter a number')
     print(a)


def math():
      a = input('please enter a number')
      b = 30
      print("here is your result")
      print(int(a) + b)

math()



# create a function that calculates 2 unique user inputted numbers

def calculate():
      a = input(' please enter a number')
      b = input('please enter another number:')
      print(int(a) + int(b))
      print(int(a) + int(b))
      print(int(a) + int(b))
      print(int(a) + int(b))
      print(int(a) + int(b))
      print(int(a) + int(b))
      print(int(a) + int(b))
